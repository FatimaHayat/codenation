    <h3 class="card-header">MEET YOUR TRAINER - RICHIE RICH
        <P>There was a time i felt uncomfortable in my clothes and my skin. 
        I knew that i was carrying a little bit of extra weight compared to
    my friends around my age, and looking back now, it wasn't even that much.
    But it was enough at the time to knock my confidence-it got me down and i tried to diet.  </P>

    <p>I didn't know what i was doing, i had no direction and without a plan, i made a lot
        of mistakes.  I started to learn about nutrition and making slightly better food choices.
        I learned about training plans and making sure that the time i was spending in the gym was
        effective.<p>

    </p>Then, in 2002 i joined the military.  That was a pivotal time in my life because now my 
    fitness wasn't just about how i looked and felt, it could have meant life or death for myself,
    my friends and colleagues in my company.  I took it seriously and got military fit.  It was a
    life-changing journey and for the first time, i felt i fitted in.
    </p>

    <p>I was in the military for over 15 years.  When i left, i took a high profile management position
        with a lot of responsibility and stress.  This led me away from my core passion of fitness
        and helping others achieve their health and wellbeing goals.  I was in that job for two years,
        where the long and demanding hours meant my health took a back seat again.
        I knew that i didn't want to live that life and wanted to do something i have always been
        passionate about - ultimately leading me back into the fitness industry.

<h4 class="card-header">WHY CHOOSE TOTAL RESULTS TRAINING
    <P>At Total Results Training, i want to help men and women that have felt
    like they've been spinning their wheels with their fitness and health.  
    I grasp that different diets can seem attractive and trying various
    solutions to find the style of eating that's right for you seems essential
    but it can also slow your progress down while you are spending time on trial 
    and error.<p>
    I launched Total Body Fitness in Manchester, so i can help people cut to the chase      
    and find what works for them best as a result of using science-backed methods and 
    individualisation protocols that will bring the results they desire.  If you've just 
    started working out, but you'd like to make the best out of your sessions, I am here 
    to help.  If you've been training for some time but feel like you're stuck with your 
    progress, I will show you how to overcome the plateau and start seeing results again. 
</P>
